## Table Columns

The affiliates table shows:

4. **Paste and share with affiliate**

## Example

For affiliate #30483, you'll see:

```
Referral URL Column:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ https://tryfleur.com/?ref=30483  [Copy] │ ← Primary (blue)
│ https://tryfleur.com/ref/30483   [Copy] │ ← Alternative (gray)
│ Query (Primary) or Path (Alternative)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Which Link to Give Affiliates?

**Recommendation: Give them the Query Parameter link (Primary)**
- `https://tryfleur.com/?ref=30483`
- Works on any page (they can add `?ref=30483` to any URL)
- Matches Refersion format (familiar to affiliates)
- More flexible for campaigns

## If Affiliate Doesn't Have a Link

If an affiliate shows "—" in the Referral URL column:
- They don't have an `affiliate_number` assigned yet
- The affiliate needs to be created with an affiliate number
- Or the affiliate number needs to be generated

## Quick Access

**Direct Path:**
```
Admin Dashboard → Sidebar → "Affiliates" → Table → "Referral URL" Column
```
